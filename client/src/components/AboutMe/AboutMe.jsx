      <p className="about-me-text">
        Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ludvig, a dedicated student on my second year, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Lunds University, Faculty of Engineering.
      </p>
      <p className="about-me-text">
        At Lunds University, I have taken a diverse range of courses including Scala, Java, Linear Algebra, Multilinear Algebra, Calculus, Program Valuation, Object Oriented Design and Modeling,  Photonics and so on. These courses have provided me with a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of programming and understanding hardware.
      </p>
      <p className="about-me-text">
        In my own spare time I have created several projects including: web apps with React, trading bot in python with PyTorch, yahoofinance, pandas, and programming of my own built keyboard.
      </p>
      <p className="about-me-text">
        My key skills include solid and deep understanding of programming concepts, testing and valuating programs, and web applications. Within my studies I have worked on projects such as building an Excel program with an extnesive amount of tools in Java and more, where I was able to apply my knowledge and collaborate with peers to achieve our goals.
      </p>
      <p className="about-me-text">
        Looking ahead, I aspire to become a valuable peice to a bigger project and learn as much as possible in order for that to happen. I am particularly interested in neuro networks, artificial intelligence, creating software for hardware, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this field.
      </p>
      <p className="about-me-text">
        Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy working out, socializing and wokring out. These activities help me stay balanced and inspired.
      </p>
